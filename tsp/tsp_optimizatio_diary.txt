9. Trace: [0,1,4,2,3], Distance: 732.81

Please provide a new trace different from previous traces that visits all 5 points exactly once, starting from point 0, and results in a shorter total distance than the previous traces. The trace should be a list of integers from 0 to 4 in the format:

[0, 2, 1, 3, 4, ..., N]

Make sure to include each point exactly once and do not repeat any points. Do not include any explanations or additional text.

Model Response:
[0, 2, 3, 1, 4]


Distance:524.64
Duplicate trace or not improved.

Optimization Step 19

Prompt:
We have the following points with their coordinates:
0: (-70.43, 48.9)
1: (64.77, 23.14)
2: (-89.72, -9.87)
3: (89.94, -92.88)
4: (20.59, 55.7)

Here are some previous traces and their total distances (shorter distances are better):
1. Trace: [0,4,1,3,2], Distance: 524.64
2. Trace: [0,2,3,1,4], Distance: 524.64
